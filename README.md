# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handerswith-Left-Handers
This project looks into the idea that left-handed people die younger than right-handed people. The goal is to show that the difference in average age at death might be because of changes in how common left-handedness was in the pastâ€”not because being left-handed is actually more dangerous.

National Geographic survey in 1986 resulted in over a million responses that included age, sex, and hand preference for throwing and writing. Researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki analyzed this data and noticed that rates of left-handedness were around 13% for people younger than 40 but decreased with age to about 5% by the age of 80. They concluded based on analysis of a subgroup of people who throw left-handed but write right-handed that this age-dependence was primarily due to changing social acceptability of left-handedness. This means that the rates aren't a factor of age specifically but rather of the year you were born, and if the same study was done today, we should expect a shifted version of the same distribution as a function of age. Ultimately, we'll see what effect this changing rate has on the apparent mean age of death of left-handed people, but let's start by plotting the rates of left-handedness as a function of age.

This notebook uses two datasets: death distribution data(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/vs00199_table310.pdf.) for the United States from the year 1999 (source website: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_tables.htm.) and rates of left-handedness digitized from a figure in this 1992 paper by Gilbert and Wysocki(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1528408.).
