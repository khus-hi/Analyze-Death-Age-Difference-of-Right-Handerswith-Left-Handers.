# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handerswith-Left-Handers.
This project looks into the idea that left-handed people die younger than right-handed people. The goal is to show that the difference in average age at death might be because of changes in how common left-handedness was in the pastâ€”not because being left-handed is actually more dangerous.
